# PriorityTask

**PriorityTask** is a priority-based task management web application designed to help users focus on what matters most instead of treating all tasks equally.

This project is being built as part of **Genesis 1.0 Hackathon** and is developed as a **solo project** under the OneDev identity.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Most traditional to-do applications list tasks without emphasizing priority.  
As a result, users often feel overwhelmed and struggle to decide which task should be done first.

There is a need for a simple system that:
- Highlights task importance
- Encourages intentional planning
- Reduces decision fatigue

---

## 💡 Solution

PriorityTask introduces a **priority-first workflow** where tasks are organized based on their importance.  
Users can quickly identify high-priority tasks and focus their energy on meaningful work.

The application keeps the interface minimal and distraction-free, making it suitable for students and individual learners.
