# PriorityTask

**PriorityTask** is a priority-based task management web application designed to help users focus on what matters most instead of treating all tasks equally.

This project is being built as part of **Genesis 1.0 Hackathon** and is developed as a **solo project** under the OneDev identity.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Most traditional to-do applications list tasks without emphasizing priority.  
As a result, users often feel overwhelmed and struggle to decide which task should be done first.

There is a need for a simple system that:
- Highlights task importance
- Encourages intentional planning
- Reduces decision fatigue

---

##  Solution

PriorityTask introduces a **priority-first workflow** where tasks are organized based on their importance.  
Users can quickly identify high-priority tasks and focus their energy on meaningful work.

The application keeps the interface minimal and distraction-free, making it suitable for students and individual learners.

##  Hackathon Conclusion

PriorityTask was developed as a solo project during the Genesis 1.0 Hackathon with the goal of building a usable, real-world productivity tool within a limited time frame.

Over the course of the hackathon, I successfully designed, implemented, and deployed a functional MVP that supports priority-based task management, authentication, persistent storage, and AI-assisted planning. The project demonstrates my ability to take an idea from concept to a live product under time constraints.

Due to the short development window and solo nature of the project, a few UI edge cases and interaction inconsistencies remain. These have been identified and documented and will be addressed in future iterations.

Overall, the hackathon was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my skills in full-stack development, problem scoping, and decision-making under deadlines.

Although the project was not shortlisted among the top submissions, the hackathon experience was extremely valuable. Building PriorityTask as a solo developer helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills, improve my ability to scope features realistically, and gain confidence in shipping a complete product under tight deadlines.
